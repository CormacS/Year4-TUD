    "Our program focuses on taking a clear image of a hand which displays a letter from the Irish Sign Language alphabet.

In order to keep our program away from machine learning and focus only on image processing we are detecting the most distinct letters which in this case are A,W,L,C. \n",

    "To get these results we used the following techniques: resize, to change the images to the same size as our tempaltes, we used segmentation in order to get the ROI using inRange and morphology,canny for edge detection, countouring to get the contours using our canny, sorted contours based on area which allowed us to make a bounding rectangle around the biggest contour. This allowed us to use the rectangle to get the width and height of each sign, finally we would use these dimensions to compare with user images in order to determine which sign they are displaying."

    "## Instructions\n",
    "The program offers two option, 1) Input from an Image 2) input from webcam. For the first option when chosing your image. You need to select an image from your computer that you want to check for sign language. Make sure when uploading an image of the hand,the image as an appropriate background and appropriate distance from the camera. You can use the template and as example of what the image should look like. After you upload the image the program will display what sign you were displaying (program works for the detection of 4 signs A, C, W and L ). \n",
    "\n",
    "The Second option opens up your camera, if you do not have a camera the program will give out. After the camera opens please insert you hand with the sign language sign that you wish to detect (out of A, C, L and W ). Once you get the hand into the rectangle press S. After pressing S the program captures the image inside the square and then presents you with the result."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, we planned the program to detect Irish Sign Language alphabet from an image and then later from the camera. We managed to read in the images and get images from the camera. The issue we encountered is that the skin detection seems to be really difficult to master so the image / webcam need to be against an appropriate background in order to secure an accurate result. Because a lot of letters in the ISL are very similar we had to chose images that looked the most distinct, which in our case were the signs for A, L ,C and W. Another issue that we had is that we could not find any other way of giving the result without stepping into machine learning, even after researching online most solutions used machine learning, the only way we found it to work is as follows. We got the contours and then created bounded rectangles around the contours because the images are distinct from each other some turn out the be wider / longer then others which means that by those dimensions we are able to differentiate between the images. However this solution only works when the user keeps a similar distance when taking an image / using the webcam as per the templates and also the background has to be appropriate."
